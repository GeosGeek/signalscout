# Signal Scout - scout public radio signal anywhere!

Ham and GMRS repeaters in one map! This project demonstrates how to create a simple web map using Leaflet.js and load local JSON data to display markers for various locations.

## Overview


Outdoor enthusiasts use handheld radios to communicate with friends, family, or even emergency services. Their tools of choice are often FRS, GMRS, or Ham radios. Although the latter two options require an FCC license to transmit, they enable operators to use repeaters, significantly increasing the transmission range of a low-power handheld radio.

Signal Scout displays both Ham and GMRS repeater locations, so operators can choose their loadout accordingly.

Signal Scout fetches open source Ham and GMRS repeater data and displays it on a Leaflet map. Each marker represents a repeater, with details shown in a popup when clicked.

## Features

- Interactive map with Leaflet.js
- Dynamic loading of local JSON data
- Markers for each repeater location

# Leaflet Map Application

This project demonstrates how to create a simple web map using Leaflet.js and load local JSON data to display markers for various locations.

## Overview

The application fetches repeater data from a local JSON file (`repeaters.json`) and displays it on a Leaflet map. Each marker represents a repeater, with details shown in a popup when clicked.

## Features

- Interactive map with Leaflet.js
- Dynamic loading of local JSON data
- Markers for each repeater location
- Popup information for each marker

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Python (for running a local server)
  - Or Node.js (if you prefer to use `http-server`)
